# Charts

This project demonstrates how to use the chart library ngx-charts (formerly ng2d3). It was generated with [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-beta.24.

## State of the art
Currently, this project only shows the one of the official demos, which I've extracted from the library source codes and moved into an Angular CLI project. Soon there's more to see.
